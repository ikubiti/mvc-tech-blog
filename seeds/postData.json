To help you get started, this guide explains how to set up your Git environment and introduces some commonly used Git and terminal commands.\n\n For more information, please visit https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/git/getting-started-with-git.",

For one thing, it will most likely be the first place that potential employers look to evaluate your skills and professionalism. And it also allows you to connect with and showcase your work to other developers, which can lead to interesting collaborations.\n\nA key component of your profile, and one that many new developers overlook, is the README file that's associated with each repository. A README file acts like a virtual storefront to a repositoryâ€”it's the first thing that a person sees when they visit a repo on GitHub. But it's also much more than that: README files contain essential information about the repo's project. Thus, the quality of a README file can differentiate a high-quality repo from a low-quality one.\n\n For more information, please visit https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide.",

    "content": "Node.js is an asynchronous JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. This allows developers to code the back ends of their applications using JavaScript instead of another programming language. Node.js runs scripts on the server side to produce dynamic webpage content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.\n\nNode.js has two versions. The LTS version is the most recent stable version that typically guarantees that critical bugs have been fixed or a period of time, often up to 30 months. Apps built for production or requiring a reliable Node.js version should always use LTS releases.\n\nThe Current version is the most recent release of Node.js. All new Node.js releases enter a current release period of six months. During this time, the content authors have time to identify major bugs and troubleshoot the build.\n\nSince users of the current version may face incompatibility issues and bugs that are not yet addressed, it is important to download the tested and stable LTS version to make sure your app -- and Node.js -- perform as expected\n\n For more information, please visit https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/nodejs/how-to-install-nodejs.",
